# Code Optimization Tips for Large Projects in Next.js

## 1. Choose Between SSR and CSR

- **SSR (Server-Side Rendering):**
  - Best for displaying data-intensive products on an e-commerce site.
  - Generates HTML once and fetches data from the server when needed.
  - Enhances site performance by minimizing HTML generation.

- **CSR (Client-Side Rendering):**
  - May lead to decreased performance for data-related products.
  - Creates HTML for each data request, potentially impacting site performance.
  - Best suited for handling user interactions like checkout and order confirmation.

## 2. Image Optimization

- Optimize images to improve site performance and avoid LCS warnings (Largest Contentful Paint).
- Next.js provides an Image tag that optimizes images by default.
- Utilize npm packages like Sharp for additional image optimization in production.
- Leverage built-in lazy loading in Next.js to load images efficiently.
- Use 'priority=true' to prioritize critical images for faster loading.

## 3. Dynamic Imports

- Utilize dynamic imports to improve page loading times, especially for pages with multiple sections and images.
- Dynamic imports allow for lazy loading of components, enhancing overall site performance.
- This feature is a valuable asset in Next.js for optimizing large projects.

## 4. Consider CSR for Specific Use Cases

- For actions such as checkout, quantity adjustments, and order confirmation, consider using CSR.
- Since Next.js generates HTML during build time, these operations can benefit from CSR to prevent server overload and improve user experience.
